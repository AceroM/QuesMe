#### Overview
QuesMe is an interactive website that enhances student to teacher engagement into the 21st century by taking in anonymous student questions which is sent to the teacher in real time. Other students will be able to vote on questions and the most popular question will grow in size indicating that is a topic/question most students have. The professor will be able to see this activity through their own page. 

#### Inspiration
Throughout our education, it has always been a teacher to student relationship and this may not always be the best teaching/learning environment because it lacks input from the students. 

#### How we built it!

- Node.js
- Redux
- React for the frontend
- Express for the backend
- Postgresql

#### Installation and how to run the site
  *Make sure you have Node and React installed. If you don't you can install it with these commands.
  If you're using a Mac you can use Homebrew to install Node with:

  ```sh
  $ brew install node
  ```
  If you're running Ubuntu you can use:
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install nodejs
  ```

  After installing Node, type in terminal:

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
  ```
  For the backend, cd to the root folder and type:

  ```sh
  $ node app.js
  ```
  This should run the Postgres database on http://localhost:5000 

  The program should now run on http://localhost:3000
